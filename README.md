I compiled all of these in clang using c++23

e.g. Compile day 3 part 1 by running `clang++ --std=c++23 3a.cpp`

Then run by passing the input file as a command line parameter: `./a.out 3.txt`

To get an input to use with the day, go to www.adventofcode.com

NOTE: I don't have source for days 1 and 2 because I solved those with vim macros

ALSO NOTE: Apple Clang didn't have some stuff I wanted (e.g. std::ranges::to) so I'm using clang++ 17
